# Proxmox-Guides

This is a repo of user guides for setting up various servers on Proxmox, particularly for an N100 mini PC. I am a complete novice to Proxmox at the time of making these guides and work mainly in Windows, not Linux, so some things may not be as efficient or well done as they could be. However, they should at the very least work.

The guides are in the [Wiki](https://github.com/slunat/Proxmox-Guides/wiki) here.
